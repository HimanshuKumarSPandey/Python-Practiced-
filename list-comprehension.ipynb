    "# List Comprehension\n",
    "This directory is here to show the Speed Difference between using \n",
    "List Comprehension vs. calling append() in a For Loop to create a list\n",
    "\n",
    "## Executing\n",
    "Standard append loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "l2 = []\n",
    "for i in range(100000000):\n",
    "\tl.append(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In a UNIX terminal, run:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "time python list-append-loop.py\n",
    "\n",
    "real\t0m11.381s\n",
    "user\t0m10.553s\n",
    "sys\t0m0.824s\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "List comprehension:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "l1 = [x for x in range(100000000)]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In a UNIX terminal, run:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "time python list-comp.py\n",
    "\n",
    "real\t0m4.228s\n",
    "user\t0m3.428s\n",
    "sys\t0m0.800s\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we see that the list comprehension was almost 3x as fast\n",
    "as the `list.append()` for loop. This is because everytime the\n",
    "append() method is called, it has to be looked up by the Interpreter,\n",
    "whereas the list comprehension can do it all at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disclaimer\n",
    "Since this is a very simple example where we are just creating a list of\n",
    "numbers with the range() function, we can actually just cast the result\n",
    "of the range() function to a list and get even faster speed than the\n",
    "list comprehension. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "l = list(range(100000000))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In a UNIX terminal, run:\n",
    "```\n",
    "time python cast-list.py\n",
    "\n",
    "real\t0m2.988s\n",
    "user\t0m2.176s\n",
    "sys\t0m0.812s\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To show a more practical example where you can't just cast it:\n",
    "\n",
    "More complicated example with append loop:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "l2 = []\n",
    "for i in range(1000000):\n",
    "\tl.append(i**2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In a UNIX terminal, run:\n",
    "```\n",
    "time python list-append-loop2.py\n",
    "\n",
    "real\t0m29.756s\n",
    "user\t0m28.875s\n",
    "sys\t0m0.880s\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Same thing with list comprehension:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "l1 = [x**2 for x in range(1000000)]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In a UNIX terminal, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "time python list-comp2.py\n",

    "user\t0m21.031s\n",
    "sys\t0m0.900s\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this practical example, we see that the list comprehension finished\n",
    "in about 2/3 of the time it took the for loop append() method, still\n",
    "significantly faster!\n",
    "\n",
    "All in all, it depends on the example, but list comprehensions are often\n",
    "faster than using a loop.\n"
